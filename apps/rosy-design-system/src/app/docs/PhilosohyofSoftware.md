A Philosophy of Software Design


Dependency is when one part of the code relies on another. In our first example, processOrder is dependent on calculateDiscountâ€”if the discount logic changes, so does the behavior of processOrder.

Obscurity happens when the code is not self-explanatory. In our second example, unclear naming and unexplained magic numbers make the code hard to understand.


Change amplification: A seemingly small change can require
editing multiple files.


Cognitive load: The volume of knowledge required to complete a
task is reflected in the time it takes to learn that knowledge and,
subsequently, create software.


Unknown unknowns: The code that needs to be changed or
information a programmer needs to successfully complete a task.
