The **Adapter Pattern** is a structural design pattern in JavaScript that allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two objects, converting one object into another that the client expects.

It works by wrapping an existing interface with a new one, making the two incompatible objects compatible.

### Key Concepts:
- **Target Interface**: The interface that the client expects. In Angular, this can be thought of as the expected interface of a form control, like a standard Angular `FormControl` or `ngModel`.
- **Adaptee**: The existing class that needs to be adapted. In Angular, this could be a custom web component or a native DOM element (like an `<input>`), which does not natively work with Angular's form control APIs.
- **Adapter**: A class that implements the target interface and translates requests from the target interface to the adaptee. In Angular, this would be the **Control Value Accessor (CVA)**, which adapts custom form controls to work with Angular forms.

### In Angular:
In the context of Angular forms, the **adaptee** is typically a custom web component or a native DOM element that doesnâ€™t fit into Angular's expected form control structure. For example, a native `<input>` element is not designed to work with Angular's form system out of the box.

The **target interface** is the Angular form control interface, which expects an implementation of `ControlValueAccessor`. This interface allows Angular forms to interact with form controls in a consistent way, regardless of whether the control is a native HTML element or a custom component.

### When should you use CVA?
For example, if you're building a custom web component input control and you want it to be compatible with Angular forms, you should implement CVA. This allows your web component to work seamlessly with Angular forms.

### Real-World Example:
Initially, you might want Angular forms to work with native inputs. Later, as you build your own component library or implement a design system, you'll want those controls to also work with Angular forms. Each input has its own event handling mechanism (adaptee), while Angular requires a consistent way to process form values (target). Implementing CVA ensures this consistency by acting as the adapter, translating between the native input or custom component and the Angular form control interface.
